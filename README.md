# flappy fish
Final project for SYDE 121 by Emad Haq, Sebastian Mendoza, and Kelly Pham.
Flappy fish is coded in C++ and played in the terminal.

The fish moves up using the 'w' key and moves down using the 's' key.

The objective of the game is to navigate the fish through through the gaps in the pipes and get the most points possible!
The pipes will gradually mpve towards the fish faster as the game continues.
Every once in a while, a power up will appear on the screen. 
If you can get the fish to collide with the power up, the speed that the pipes move will be reset to its inital speed.
